<p>The procurement of defense equipment is big business. Expenditure procurement in 1992 accounted for between 17 and 22 percent of total military expenditure for European NATO and USA, respectively (SIPRI, 1993). These share figures nations major weapons procurement only, so under-stating real arms procurement expenditure. In the UK, for example, in the early 1990s expenditure on equipment accounted for about 40 percent of defense spending.</p>
<p>Critics of defense equipment procurement policies point to the high costs of weapons, cost escalation, delays in delivery, deficiencies in performance, poor reliability, and cancellations of costly projects. Contractors are further criticized with allegations of excessive profits, waste, fraud, and inefficiency (Austin and Larkey, 1992; McNaugher,1990). Such criticisms immediately raise a methodological problem:What are the criteria for assessing procurement policy and defense contracting? Is it assumed that the ideal contract type is one of a perfect project which encounters no technical, cost or time problems? Or are comparisons being made with actual previous project experience within a country or in other countries?</p>
<p>This chapter reviews the literature on the various types of defense contracts and competitive procurement. Decisions to buy defense equipment are reflected in the award of a contract whereby a supplier provides a product or service of a specified quality over some time period in return for an agreed payment. This description simplifies the problems reflected in the transaction costs of acquiring information about products and suppliers, organizing competitions, bargaining with contractors, and then writing, monitoring, and enforcing contracts. Contracting requires the government as a buyer or principal to specify its requirements to the a contractor or agent, and to ensure that the agent pursues the goals of principal. Contracts which cannot specify all the details of a buyer’s requirements provide the contractor with opportunities for discretionary writing, behavior (e.g., pursuing managerial preferences). Similarly, monitoring, and enforcing contracts requires outputs to be specified in measurable form. However, the incentives and penalties incorporated into the contract will affect the behavior of agents: individuals and groups can play any games and the results might be unexpected and undesirable. The chapter starts by reviewing the traditional approach to defense contracting; and it then considers the literature on cost-estimating relationships and various types of contracts including the more recent theoretical developments. Throughout the survey, there will be a recent focus on the features of the market within which contracting takes place, the behavior of agents, including contractors, and their response to different contractual incentives and regulatory constraints. Competitive procurement policies are then evaluated. The opportunities for competition are assessed and consideration is given to its benefits and costs.</p>

<p>At one level, defense equipment markets are like any other market: they bring together buyers and sellers (Hooper and Buck, 1991). National defense ministries and their-armed forces as well as overseas governments demand defense equipment. On the supply side, defense industries both nationally and overseas, provide equipment. And the demand and supply sides are brought together through a legally binding contract whereby the buyer agrees to pay a certain price for specified product delivered on time. In some instances, the government a as the buyer might impose regulatory requirements on the contractor (e.g.&nbsp;profit controls). Figure 5.1 illustrates the market situation with an example from the UK.</p>
<p>Defense equipment markets, however, have some distinguishing features concerning the role of governments, cost trends, technical progress, cost curves, and regulation (Peck and Scherer, 1962):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Governments are central to understanding defense equipment markets. Where it is a monopsonist, a government determines technical progress through its choice of equipment and it sole choose whether to import or buy from its domestic industry. As can the tanks, warships), it can determine the size of its domestic defense or major buyer (e.g.&nbsp;combat aircraft, missiles, submarines, efficiency, and ownership. In this context, the view has been industry, its structure, entry and exit, prices, exports, profits, instrument expressed that defense ministry purchasing should be used interventionist “key” technologies and to back “the winners” to support of national industrial policy, awarding contracts as an industrial policy). Supporters of free markets (e.g., Austrian economists) are critical, stressing that the future is uncertain and that there are unintended secondary effects, so that today’s winners might be tomorrow’s losers; and that governments have no competence as entrepreneurs. Interestingly, public choice analysis also predicts that governments can fail in their efforts to improve economic performance. Furthermore, using defense procurement as an instrument of industrial policy raises fundamental questions about the objectives of defense policy. Is defense procurement aimed at the efficient purchasing of equipment for national defense or the pursuit of wider economic and social objectives, including protection of the national defense industrial base (Faltas, 1986; Taylor and Hayward, 1989; see also chapter 7)?</li>
<li>Defense equipment, especially high technology equipment, is costly and the trends are toward rising costs in real terms. The American B2 stealth bomber was estimated to cost $35 billion for fifteen aircraft and the US F-22 advanced tactical fighter aircraft is likely new to cost some $130 million per copy (1991-2 prices). Similarly, equipment is much costlier than the previous generations which it replaces (although the new equipment is more productive). Typically real unit production costs of defense increase equipment (aircraft, helicopters, missiles, warships, submarines) increase by about 10 percent per annum, implying a doubling in cost to every 7.25 such years (Pugh, 1993). Since defense budgets fail to match such cost increases there are inevitable downward pressures on size and formation of armed forces with an associated need to reshape the defense industries which supply the forces (e.g., the long-run trend towards a one-ship navy and a one-aircraft air force). Not surprisingly, faced with such pressures, efforts are made to introduce new procurement policies, such as competition policy, which might at least postpone some of the adjustment effects (Pugh, 1993).</li>
<li>Technical progress has been a distinctive feature of defense equipment markets. Major technical advances resulting in new products (e.g.&nbsp;jet engines, missiles, electronics, helicopters, etc.), have created new markets requiring firms to offer new development and production facilities with a greater emphasis on research and development (R &amp; D). Since 1945, the long-run trend has been towards a smaller number of larger firms, reflected in mergers and exits from the defense sector. As a result, the high technology sectors (e.g.&nbsp;aerospace, avionics) usually consist of one or a relatively few large national suppliers either publicly or privately owned (monopoly or oligopoly). Such markets are a major departure from the economists’ model of perfect competition. The cuts in defense spending in the USA, UK, and elsewhere in the EU during the 1990s are likely to reinforce the trend towards exits from the industry and restructuring around an even smaller number of large defense contractors. As a result, EU states will only be able to maintain competition by opening up their national markets to foreign suppliers.</li>
<li>A number of defense industries, particularly the high technology sectors, are characterized by decreasing costs: hence, if the aim is to exploit scale economies, a national market will only support one firm of (monopoly). In such sectors, quantity is a major determinant unit costs and hence competitiveness. Long production runs volume mean that high fixed R &amp; D costs can be spread over a larger and, in addition, there are scale and learning economies in production (Bittleston, 1990; see also section 5.4).</li>
<li>Defense markets and industries are government regulated. Governments can determine whether their national markets should be open or closed, they can insist upon monitoring costs, and there is often stage regulation of profits on defese contracts). Typically, the aim of of profit controls is to ensure that defence contractors are not making excessive profits or excessive losses on defense business; and the prevention of excessives losses is designed to retain a domestic industrial base. As a results profits on defence work might not provide the standard signaling mechanism for entry or exit. Moreover, profit-conscious firms are likely to adapt to regulatory constraints. For example where profits are controlled firms are likely to increase expenditure of unregulated items twhich give satisfaction to their managers (e.g., luxury offices, company cars, hoarding scientists and engineers: Hartley and Tisdell, 1981).</li>

<h2 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="demand-procurement-policy"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Demand: procurement policy</h2>
<p>Procurement policy represents the demand side of the defense equipment market. involves a set of related choices, with defense contracts as one element the choice set:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The choice of equipment required for the armed forces with implications for technical progress. This involves choosing between competing demands from each of the armed forces for a larger share of a limited defense budget. In principle, such choices need to be made in relation to the nation’s security requirements, regardless of the traditional monopoly property rights of each of the services. For example, why not allow the army with its land-based missiles to compete with the air force and its manned combat aircraft for a nation’s air defense (similarly aircraft versus warships)? In reality, such decisions are often made on the principle of Buggin’s Turn. Last year, the navy obtained its new aircraft carrier; this year it is the turn of the air force to receive its new fighter aircraft; next year, the army can have a new tank!</li>
<li>The choice of contractor. A contractor has to be selected either based by direct negotiation with a preferred supplier or by competition based on price and nonprice criteria, with the market restricted to domestic firms or open to foreign suppliers. Public choice analysis predicts that domestic firms will oppose opening the national market to foreign suppliers: they will lobby vote-sensitive governments claiming that relying on foreigners will impair national security and will mean and will mean the loss of jobs, technology, and valuable foreign exchange (depending on whether the exchange rate is viewed as a policy objective or policy instrument). Economists can critically appraise such arguments pointing to the costs national independence (protection); showing that there are alternative and often more efficient methods of achieving jobs, technology and other policy objectives; and raising questions as to whether the aims of defense procurement policy are to protect the nations citizens or its domestic defence industries (who is maximising what benefit for of whom? (Hartley, 1991a,b)).</li>
<li>The choice of of contract. A contract has to be selected from the extremes of firm or fixed-price contracts, a cost-plus the some firm intermediate target cost-incentive sharing arrangement. With a firm price contract, the firm receives the contract price, no more and no less. Fixed-price contracts allow for variations of price based on agreed price index reflecting inflation in labor and material price contract inputs. Where a prime contractor receives a fixed-price contract (with agreed price variations), it has every incentive to negotiate firm prices with its suppliers, so that the prime contractor appropriates all the financial benefits of price variations. An alternative solution would be to award competitively determined firm price contracts, leaving contractors to make their own judgements about future inflation, incorporating such estimates own their tender bid. Of course, another solution is to award a cost-plus in contract the in which the contractor recoups all its costs incurred project plus an agreed profit rate based on costs or with a fixed on fee. Such contracts are used for development work where there might be considerable uncertainty. Not surprisingly, these “blank cheque” contracts lead to inefficiency, labor hoarding, cost escalation and “gold-plating” (Scherer, 1964; Kennedy, 1983). A comparison of firm price and cost-plus contracts identifies two policy issues. First, how should the risks of the program be distributed between the state (buyer) and the contractor? Second, what are the implications of different contractual arrangements for firm behavior and efficiency, and for efficiently meeting the buyer’s requirements. Of course, it is not always possible for the buyer (defense ministry) to specify in advance all its detailed requirements: hence, it might prefer a contract which allows it some discretion to modify its requirements. But, once the contract has been awarded, any contract modifications have to be negotiated with the monopoly contractor.</li>
<li>The incentives to choose. Ultimately, efficient solutions depend upon the set of incentives and penalties incorporated into the employment contracts of procurement staff in the armed forces and defense ministries. Often individuals and groups in the armed forces and defense ministries have every incentive to spend: there are no inducements to economize if all the savings by, say, the navy are used to by more tanks for the army, or they eventually benefit the national Treasury.</li>
<li>How are choices made? Within any procurement organization, equipment choices will often be made by a committee. Clearly, the size of committee, its objectives, the composition of its membership, the conditions of entry and exit, the background of the chairman and the voting arrangements are central to determining actual procurement choices.</li>
</ol>
<p>Consideration of the choices and organizational arrangements outlined above are usually ignored or neglected by economists. This is not surprising since economists have often regarded governments as a “black box” which always pursues the “will of the people”. Such an approach ignores the insights provided by public choice analysis which applies the neo-classical concepts of exchange and self interest to the political market place of voters, parties, governments, bureaucracies, and interest groups; and also ignores the fact that in defense the “will of the people” is not always apparent (so providing governments and defense ministries with opportunities for discretionary behavior (Buchanan, 1986)).</p>
<p>Public choice analysis provides two predictions of relevance to defense contracting and procurement policy. First, government policies tend to favor producers more than consumers. Second, budget-maximizing bureaucracies will be inefficient: their budgets will be too large as they exaggerate the demand for their services and underestimate the costs of their preferred activities (eg, exaggerating the threat; resulting in cost escalation on equipment projects (Hartley, 1991b, chapter 5; Dunleavy,1991; Mayer, 1991)].</p>
<p>In evaluating procurement policy, economists have traditionally applied their standard economic models of free trade and competition, including the opportunities for competitive bidding at various stages in a project’s life cycle. Here, many of the pioneering contributions in the microeconomics of defense emerged in the 1960s and were made by American economists, with the Rand Corporation in the forefront. The Classic text by Hitch and McKean devoted a short section to defense contracting (Hitch and McKean, 1960, pp.&nbsp;223-33).</p>

<p>One of the early definitive economic texts in this field is The Weapons Acquisition Process: Economic Incentives (Scherer, 1964). This providens benchmark and sets the scene for assessing the subsequent theoretical, empirical, and policy developments in defence contracting. The book starts by outlining four features of the weapons acquisition process. First, development work is characterized by uncertainty and risk often resulting in the shifting of financial risks from contractors to government usually through cost-reimbursement contracts. Second, once a project starts, the contractor acquires specialized information and physical assets which restricts the government’s ability to shop around and bring in an alternative contractor. The result is a bilateral monopoly bargaining situation. Third, these features of the weapons acquisition process mean that a conventional market system is not possible: hence, the reliance on a nonmarket, quasi-administrative buyer-seller relationship. Fourth, in the absence of market forces, successful weapons acquisition requires governments to intervene either through controls on contractors or through incentive mechanisms to reward good performance and penalize poor performance. Of course, to be effective, contractors have to believe that incentive and penalty arrangements will be enforced by the government’s procurement agency. Incentives can be either competitive or contractual.</p>
<p>Competitive bidding for production contacts has been achieved via breakout and second sourcing. By the early 1960s US evidence appeared to show that competitive break-outs<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> resulted in price reductions of 20 percent compared with prices negotiated non competitively. However breakouts and competitive bidding involves costs in preparing manufacturing information at specifications, in maintaining quality, and in disputes about transfering private property rights (proprietary data). Problems also arise where the original contractor possesses immobile specialized facilties. Price competition can also be achieved through second sourcing where one or more firms are selected to produce a weapon system (or substem concurrently with the original contractor. Second sourcing was used extensively during World War II and the Korean War (often for reasons other than competition). A subsequent example of second souring involved the US Navy’s Sidewinder program. Sharing the production work between Philco (the original contractor) and General Electric (second source) on the basis of each firm’s success in reducing costs resulted in the price per unit falling to one seventh of its initial price (although the price reductions also reflected learning curve effects based on a 76 percent progress curve (Scherer, 1964, pp.&nbsp;118-19)). But as with break-out competition, second sourcing is not costless. Also, where learning economies are important, the original producer may have a decisive cost advantage over a new entrant. Or, where economies of scale are substantial, and the production order will support only one firm of optimal scale, it is inefficient to share an order between two firms (Scherer, 1964, p.&nbsp;127). In addition to competition, contractual incentives can be used to monitor and police contractors.</p>
<p>Agreement on a defense contract for development and/or production work, will reflect the preferences of the government’s procurement agency and the contractor. Governments will aim to maximize contractor efficiency incentives, minimize the risk of excessive profits paid to contractors and minimize contract outlays. With fixed-price contracts, there are conflicts between contractor efficiency incentives and the risk of excessive profits; whereas cost reimbursement contracts minimize the risk of excessive profits but at the price of removing contractor efficiency incentives and also of requiring stringent accounting and reporting requirements. Incentive contracts offer a compromise solution between the various competing goals of contractor efficiency, profitability, and contract outlays. However, governments must reach an agreement with a contractor on the type of contract to be written for a procurement decision. Here, contractors will pursue conflicting objectives concerned with profit maximization and minimizing the risk of contract failure and losses (Scherer, 1964, chapter 6). The various objectives and preferences of the buyer and the contractor have to be reconciled in a bargaining situation.</p>
<p>In negotiating a contract, the final Outcome Will reflect the bargaining power of the two parties, as well as their bargaining strategies and tactics. Clearly, contractors have every incentive to negotiate favourable cost and price targets: on cost-sharing arrangements, they will seek to shift the risks of cost overruns to the government; and where the government demands a maximum price liability, the contractor will seek the highest possible maximum price. A contractor’s knowledge of costs gives them a major advantage over the buyer in the bargaining process. Demands by the government fo access to a contractor’s accounting data will always be resisted an even where granted, accounting information is historical and does not indicate the extent of contractor inefficiency. However, the governmen is not powerless. It can use competition from either national or foreign firms to check on a contractor’s price bid. But even where contract are based on “keen” competitive prices, there might be some “incompleteness” in the contract, enabling contractors to make cost quality trade-offs (Scherer, 1964, chapter 8).</p>

<p>Industry and defence procurement agencies use various method to estimate the development and production costs for large equipment projects (e.g., aircraft, helicopters, tanks, warships). Such estimates are used in the initial planning phase for new equipment projects (eg, for use in a defense ministry’s long-term costings); or as a basis for a firm’s bid for a new project; and as a check by defense procurement agencies on the cost estimates submitted by firms. For example, defense ministry cost estimates have been used to identify the cost savings which have resulted from competition although some of the claimed savings could reflect poor estimating!</p>
<p>Typically, early estimates of the development and production costs for an advanced technology defense project are unreliable. American and British studies show that projects usually increased in real cost by some 40-70 percent from their earliest estimates to completion (MoD, 1988; Pugh, 1993; Perry et al., 1971). Such cost escalation results from modifications and changes in requirements, technical uncertainties making it difficult to define the work to be done and contractor optimism reflected in low bids (Martin et al., 1992). Also, governments often believe that costs will be lowest when a contract is awarded to the firm whose initial estimate or bid is lowest. However, it is possible that low estimates in themselves create conditions that contribute to cost escalation; and there is some limited support for this hypothesis (Large, 1974). In the circumstances, it needs to be recognized that early cost estimates are notoriously unreliable: a situation which requires either better estimating techniques and/or alternative procurement policies (e.g.&nbsp;competitive fixed-price contracts for development work). Here, though, some analysts have recommended caution. It has been suggested that no single procurement method or acquisition strategy can possibly serve for all situations. Whilst incremental development or prototyping are appropriate in some circumstances neither should be recommended as universal practice (Martin et al., 1992 p.&nbsp;72).</p>
<p>The methods used to estimate costs include: 1. Engineering estimates 2. Comparative methods 3. Parametric methods 4. Learning curves</p>

<h3 data-number="2.4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="comparative-methods"><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2</span> Comparative Methods</h3>
<p>Comparative methods are based on historical comparisons of similar projects (c.g., combat aircraft; transport aircraft). For example, on UK combat aircraft development work, graphs of the relationship between technical man hours per pound of empty weight and the date of start show a positive and increasing trend over time: hence the launch costs for a 1970 combat aircraft were some fifteen times greater than that of a 1930s combat aircraft (Boot, 1990, p.&nbsp;213). Rules of thumb are also used. For example, on UK guided weapons a typical ratio of development cost to unit production cost might be 1,000:1; for combat aircraft with an existing engine, the corresponding ratio might be 100:1; and for warships the ratio is under 1:1 [based on 1,000 guided weapons; 100 aircraft, respectively (Pugh, 1986, p.&nbsp;346)]. Similarly, rules of thumb might be used to estimate lifecycle costs comprising acquisition and ownership costs (i.e., R &amp; D, production, operating, maintenance, and disposal costs). UK evidence suggests that on warships, development and procurement account for 25 percent of life cycle costs whilst for combat aircraft the corresponding share might be 13 percent [based on six ships in a class over twenty-five years; 250 aircraft produced over twenty-five years (Pugh, 1986, p.&nbsp;124)). But, of course, rules of thumb and extrapolation based on past relationships might need to be adjusted to allow for variations in the complexity of new programs compared with “typical” projects.</p>

<p>Methodologies also exist for forecasting future R &amp; D project costs. These are often based on the cost profiles of historical R &amp; D project data which map the relationship between the cumulative proportion of both project costs and project time. Typically, project R&amp;D costs are front loaded, rising steeply toward the midpoint of the system development project, then falling steeply with production beginning about half way through the program. Cavin (1991) has formulated an optimal control model of new weapon system development which is broadly consistent with the empirical data.</p>
<p>Parametric methods are based on multiple regression analysis and have been widely used, particularly for estimating the development and production costs of aerospace equipment. Much of the published work in this field has emerged from the US Rand Corporation. Typically, log-linear equations are used in which engineering and manufacturing hours are estimated as a function of aircraft weight, speed, and the number of aircraft produced (Elstub, 1969). A Rand study based on a limited post-1960 sample of US military aircraft found that the most accurate cost-Estimating relationships (as exponential equations) were based as empty weight and speed. Incorporating aditional variables for program structure and airframe construction characteristics (eg. wing type, number of black boxes, contractor experience) did not improve the overall fit of the equations (Hess and Romanoff, 1987). However, it was recognised that the Rand equations might not be applicable for estimating the costs of future aircraft. Changes in airframe materials (E.g composites), design concepts (e.g., stealth), systems integration, and manufacturing techniques are likely to affect the reliability of conventional cost-estimating relationships (Hess and Romanoff, 1987). Similar models have also been developed for estimating the cost changes in US Navy ship-building programs. These statistical models show that man hours per ship depend on such variables as the number of workers, the average daily hours worked, the experience and skill level of labor force, the ship construction sequence, the labor input applied to other programs, and delays in ship delivery. In its log-linear form, the model explained 94 percent to 99 percent of the variations in man hours ship, with learning curves of 78-88 percent for two programs (Hammond and Graham, 1983).</p>

<h3 data-number="2.4.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learning-curves"><span class="header-section-number">2.4.4</span> Learning Curves</h3>
<p>Learning curves apply to production programs, and are widely used by governments and industry for cost-estimating and contract negotia tions. They reflect the fact that productivity increases with experience. (hence they have been called experience curves) and they provide a basis for estimating manufacturing costs. Learning curves are usually expressed:</p>
<p>y = aX^-b where y = number of man hours per unit produced, a = man hours required for the first unit, b = slope of the learning curve usually defined in relation to a doubling of cumulative output.</p>
<p>Although originally estimated for the aircraft industry and widely used throughout the world’s aerospace industries, learning curves also apply to a range of defense equipment and to civil products such as electrical appliances, machine tools, petroleum refining, and steel industries. An 80 percent learning curve, which is often used in aircraft manufacture, indicates that direct labor inputs decline by 20 percent for each doubling of the cumulative output of a given aircraft (Asher, 1956; Hartley, 1969).</p>
<p>A distinction can be made between unit and cumulative average learning curves with the unit curve referring to the man hours required for the nth unit (marginal), whilst the cumulative average refers to the average time required to produce a total of n units. Both unit and cumulative average curves can have 80 percent slopes and, after an initial output has been produced, they become parallel in their log-linear form (Sissons, 1986,р. 89).</p>
<p>Examples of labor learning curves based on European experience for a variety of defense equipment are shown in table 5.1. The slopes of the curves range between 75 percent and 96 percent, with a median slope of 85 percent to 90 percent. There is evidence of a limit to learning, especially for warships, where the limit occurs between four and twelve units. Even where learning is continuous, it is often assumed that the curve tends to flatten out with greater output. However, learning curves are not unit cost curves. The effect of labor learning on unit production costs will depend on the share of labor costs in total production costs. On aircraft, for example, labor can represent 30-50 percent of total costs; for helicopters, the labor share can be 30 percent; and for missiles, electronics and tanks, the labor share can vary between 27 percent and 33 percent (Hartley and Cox, 1992).</p>
<p>Inevitably, using learning curves as a cost-estimating technique encounters difficulties. Both the a and b parameters have to be estimated (i.e., man hours for unit 1 and the slope of the curve: see table 5.1) and questions arise as to whether learning continues indefinitely and whether the b parameter remains constant. Moreover, the introduction of modifications and breaks in production can affect learning (e.g., leading to jagged effects). More generally, problems arise because the underlying determinants and causes of learning have not been explained satisfactorily. Instead, there are various hypotheses about operator and management learning, the impact of machine intensive operations compared with assembly work, and the effect labor turnover and payment systems (Large et al., 1974; Hartley, Sissons, 1986).</p>

<p>The general area of cost-estimating relationships is deficient in the industrial economics domain. There is a lack of good quality industrial economics case studies of cost conditions in defense industries. Here, there is a need for evidence on the shape of long-run average cost curves, minimum efficient scale, the relative position of long-run cost curves between different nations (opportunities for trade) and the relationship between scale and learning curves (see chapter 7).</p>
<p>Nor is it possible to ignore the tremendous differences in the scale of output between the USA and EU member states with implications for unit costs. Efficient production will become an even more important policy issue as nations reduce their defense spending and “stretch-out” production programs so as to maintain a domestic defense industrial base. In the USA some attention has been given to the cost implications of stretching-out production and whether defense plants are “too large.” Evidence exists on the minimum and maximum economic annual production rates for American combat aircraft, missiles, and land equipment (e.g., the minimum economic rate for F-15 aircraft is 120 units per annum; for the Apache helicopter 72 units per annum; for the M-1 tank 720 units per annum). Decreasing basic production rates of US modern weapons systems by 50 percent could increase real unit costs by from 7 percent to over 50 percent; whilst a 50 percent increase in output would reduce unit costs by 3-18 percent (CBO 1987; see chapter 7).</p>
<p>As nations reduce their defense spending and search for efficiency savings, they are increasingly likely to examine the cost implications of the current scale of their domestic defense plants and the extent of excess capacity. There is a widely held view in the defense community that weapons production occurs in plants which are too large relative to the outputs actually produced. US evidence suggests that inefficient production is in fact occurring: data identifying a particular weapons system as having large amounts of excess capacity and/or steeply declining short-run average cost curves can be interpreted as implying that production is occurring in an inefficiently large plant. Thus, existing outputs could be produced more cheaply in smaller-scale plants (Rogerson, 1991a and b).</p>

<p>Since the pioneering work of Scherer (1964), there have been a variety of theoretical developments which have been incorporated into the literature on defense contracting:- 1. The buyer-seller relationship is treated in a principal-agent framework with the defense ministry as the principal (buyer and regulator) and the prime contractor as the agent [supplier and regulated firm (McAfee and McMillan, 1986a; Laffont and Tirole, 1993)]. 2. Transaction costs and contract theory. Specifying, negotiating, agreeing, and monitoring contracts involves transaction costs; transactions are characterized by bounded rationality (limited information) and opportunism (incentives to hoard valuable information); and, inevitably, many contracts are incompletely specified (Williamson, 1986). 3. There are information asymmetries between the buyer and contractor in situations of uncertainty and where procurement is characterized by adverse selection, moral hazard and risk sharing between purchaser and supplier (Cummins, 1977). Adverse selection means that the government does not know the firm’s expected costs and moral hazard arises where the government cannot observe the selected contractor’s efforts to minimize costs (e.g., firms which pay only a small share of any cost overruns have a diminished economic incentive to minimize costs). Game theory has been used to analyze strategic behavior and interaction by both the purchaser and the contractors (Laffont, 1986; Shubik, 1983). 4. It has been recognized that defense contractors might not be profit maximizers, especially in imperfect and regulated markets Williamson, 1986). 5. Efficient outcomes do not require large numbers of firms in an industry (as in the perfectly competitive model). Instead, contestability (the threat of rivalry) rather than industry structure determines performance (Baumol, 1982). 6. Public choice analysis and economic models of regulation provid new insights into procurement policy (Cowen and Lee, 1992, Leitzel 1992; Lichtenberg, 1989).</p>
<p>The following sections will survey the major theoretical developments, their implications for understanding the problems of defense contracting and their contributions to policy formulation. Issues associated with regulation are reviewed later in this chapter (see also Hartley and Hooper, 1990, pp.&nbsp;440-99).</p>

<h2 data-number="2.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="game-theory-and-procurement"><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Game theory and procurement</h2>
<p>In chapters 2-4, games figured prominently in the analysis at various points. A game involves two or more agents (players) whose interactions determine their payoffs or outcomes. A noncooperative game is characterized by the players, their strategies, and the outcomes associated with various strategy combinations. In chapter 2, for example, allies decided their defense levels, based on the aggregate defense levels (spillins) of the other allies and based on economic factors. Higher levels of spillins provided an ally with free-riding opportunities that would, in turn, make it reduce its own defense provision. A Nash equilibrium was depicted as the simultaneous determination of defense levels and was used to derive demand curves (chapters 2-3). Strategic interactions other than Nash (e.g., leader-follower) were also discussed. In chapter 4, the agents included two or more adversaries whose choices of defence level were interdependent. Both static and dynamic game representations were presented. Arms races resulted when the arming of one nation induces the other nation to follow suit.</p>
<p>.. Insert last paragraph here</p>
<p>period. The game is solved backwards by first depicting the optimizing choice in the second period and then using this choice as a constraint on the optimizing choice in the first period. In so doing, the agents are made to anticipate their counterpart’s reaction to their own behavior.</p>
<p>Information is relevant to the procurement problem when one player is informed and the other is not about, say, a random variable. This situation is termed asymmetric information and is germane to principal agent problems in which the agent knows its own effort but the principal, while able to observe an outcome, cannot observe effort. Suppose that ex-post cost <span class="math inline">\(c_j\)</span>, is made up of three components: (1) the agent’s expected cost of the project, <span class="math inline">\(c_i^*\)</span> (2) an additive random variable, <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span>, and (3) cost reducing effort, <span class="math inline">\(e_i\)</span>;. Thus, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[c_i=c_i^*+\psi-e_i\]</span></p>
<p>Suppose further that the contractor (the principal) can monitor ex post cost, but its three components’ values are only known to the agent. Thus, high ex post cost may result from low effort to reduce cost or a bad draw of the random factor, or both. The principal is unable to determine whether nature or the agent is the cause behind cost overruns. To motivate the agent, the principal must design an incentive scheme or contract where expending high effort is a dominant strategy (i.e., it rewards the agent with higher payoffs regardless of the state of nature).</p>
<p>McAfee and McMillan (1986a, 1986b) examined bidding for contracts in a principal-agent framework where n potential agents bid for a defence procurement contract. If the agents are risk averse and the principal is risk neutral, then the optimal (linear) incentive compatible contract is never cost plus and is usually an incentive contract with risks shared (McAfee and McMillan, 1986a). For an incentive contract, the agent receives a fixed-price (i.e., its bid price) and a proportion of the cost overrun (i.e., the difference between the actual cost and the bid cost). As this proportion falls, the agent is motivated to keep costs down after getting the contract, since more of the cost overrun falls on its shoulders. But the agent is also expected to raise its bid during the competitive round as too low a bid puts greater cost on the agent as the sharing proportion falls. Additionally, a fall in the recoverable proportion of cost overruns means greater risks for the agent, who will require greater compensations. An optimal contract fixes the risk-sharing proportion so as to equiate the marginal benefit from greater cost-reduction effort by the agennt with the marginal cost from reduced-bidding competition and larger compesnation for risk-sharing.</p>
<p>The problem is solved in three steps. First the agent’s choice effort is ascertained for a given sharing proportion and bid so to maximize the firm’s expected utility of profit, with expectation taken over period <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Second, the agent’s optimal bid for each sharing proportion is determined in which effort choices are constrained by the first step. Third, the principal chooses the sharing proportion to minimize its expected cost, while constrained by the agent’s optimizing bid and effort choices derived in the first two steps. This is a noncooperative game, because the strategic interactions of the two players - the military (contractor) and the firm (the agent) - are taken into account. The principal moves first and fixes the parameter of the contract, then the agent acts to decide its bid and, if successful, its effort choice. Since the game is solved backwards, the solution is found in reverse order.</p>
<p>In two interesting contributions, William Rogerson (1990, 1991b) presented two sequential game representations of the procurement process. In one representation, the military first chooses the quality or sophistication of a weapon system, and then the Congress chooses an output level, taking the military choice of quality as given. Asymmetric goals characterize the players: the military is concerned with maximizing the military value of a proposed weapons system, while the Congress is interested in maximizing the net (of cost) military value of a proposed weapons system. Rogerson (1990) showed that the organizational selling for military procurement decision making leads to a greater than first best level for quality. The resulting level for quantity may be too greal or too little and depends, among other things, on whether quality und quantity are substitutable.</p>
<p>For purposes of illustration, we focus on Rogerson’s (1991a) game analysis of weapons procurement when plant scale and output levels are decided. The game again consists of two players: the military and the Congress. Rogerson demonstrated that the plant scale and output are too high in equilibrium. Furthermore, output is produced in too large a plant, which, in turn, raises per-unit cost. The military is bbetter informed about technical design decisions concerning production facilities than is the Congress and, hence, the latter delegates the scale of plant decision to the military. After scale is decided, the Congress determines the output decision. By choosing a larger than first best scale decision, the military is able to induce the Congress to pick a larger than first-best output level. This follows because an augmented scale reduces marginal cost and this, in turn, increases attractiveness of higher production runs</p>
<p>The first-best problem corresponds to <span class="math display">\[\max _{x,s}[V(x)-C(x, s)]\]</span></p>
<p>Where x is output, s is plant scale, V(.) is the military value function of the weapons, and C(,) is the cost function. V(·) is assumed to be an increasing, strictly concave function, and CO is assumed to be a strictly convex function. The latter increases in output. A unique first-best solution (x<em>, s</em>) is assumed to exist and is strictly preferred to (0, 0). For a given output level, a second-best scale minimizes cost and corresponds to</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\min _s C(x, s) .\]</span></p>
<p>We denote the unique second-best scale for each x &gt; 0 as <span class="math inline">\(\psi(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Given s, a second-best output level follows from</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\max [V(x)-C(x, s)]
\]</span></p>
<p>where the difference between military value and procurement cost denotes the net social surplus perceived by the Congress from the weapons. The second-best level of output, associated with equation <span class="math inline">\((5.6)\)</span>, is indicated by <span class="math inline">\(\Omega(s)\)</span>. Rogerson (1991a) also assumed that there is a capacity level to scale, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{s}\)</span>, such that negative net social surpluses result for <span class="math inline">\(s&gt;\bar{s}\)</span>. If, that is, plant scale is made sufficiently large, the cost is prohibitive by exceeding the resulting military value at all output levels. Hence, a zero output level is then optimal. Clearly, even the most zealous military does not want to push scale beyond <span class="math inline">\(\bar{s}\)</span>, since 16) procurement results. At <span class="math inline">\(s&lt;\bar{s}\)</span>, a positive surplus is assumed, so that we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
V(\Omega(s))-C(\Omega(s), s) \frac{\geq}{\leq} 0&lt;=&gt;s  \frac{\geq}{\leq} \bar{s}
\]</span></p>
<p>We indicate an interior second-best output level at <span class="math inline">\(\bar{s}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}=\Omega(\bar{s})\)</span>. Finally, we assume <span class="math display">\[
G_x(x, s)&lt;0
\]</span> which implies that marginal cost of ouput falls with scale. This assumption is sufficient to imply that <span class="math inline">\(\phi^{\prime}(x)&gt;0\)</span>, or that a larger scale is optimally chosen for a larger ouptut level. (The sign of <span class="math inline">\(\phi^{\prime}(x)\)</span> follows from differentiating the first-order conditions associated with equation 4. so that <span class="math inline">\(\phi^{\prime}(x)-C_{x s} / C_{s s}\)</span>).</p>
<p>We are now prepared to investigate the equilibrium for this sequential game the military moves first and decides scale so as to maximize <span class="math inline">\(V(x)\)</span>. That is, the military is only concerned with military benefits associated with a weapons system where more weapons is preferred to less (<span class="math inline">\(V^{\prime}(x)&gt;0\)</span>).</p>
<p>The Congress then decides the choice of output to maximize the net social surplus, conditional on the military’s choice of scale. Following Rogerson (1991a) the Congress only pays for the production facilities if procurement is nonzero.</p>
<p>Working backwards, we first allow the Congress to choose a second­best output level, given s, to maximize net social surplus as depicted in (5.6). The Congress will choose a positive output provided that the net social surplus is nonzero, or that <span class="math inline">\(s &lt;= \bar{s}\)</span>; hence, we have the Congress’s choice of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> - denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\Theta(s)\)</span>- as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Theta(s)= \begin{cases}\Omega(s), &amp; s&lt;\bar{s} \\ \{0, \bar{x}\}, &amp; s=\bar{s} \\ 0, &amp; s&gt;\bar{s}\end{cases}\]</span></p>
<p>The military then chooses an <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> so as to maximize: <span class="math display">\[
\max _s V(\Theta(s)),
\]</span> where the dependency of the military choice on the anticipated behavior of the Congress is acknowledged. An equilibrium weapons program satisfies <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
&amp; \max _{x, s} V(x) \\
&amp; \text { subject to } x \in \Theta(s) .
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Both player’s choices must be mutually consistent at an equilibrium, so that <span class="math inline">\(x^e=\Theta\left(s^e\right)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s^e=\phi\left(x^e\right)\)</span>, where superscript <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> denotes equilibrium value.</p>
<p>Obviously, the military wants to choose scale to maximize <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> increases with <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. This is accomplished by choosing <span class="math inline">\(s=\bar{s}\)</span>. For each <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, an interior maximum for <span class="math inline">\(x&gt;0\)</span> must satisfy the first-order condition associated with equation (5.6) <span class="math display">\[
V^{\prime}(x)-C_x(x, s)=0 .
\]</span></p>
<p>This equation implicitly defines <span class="math inline">\(\Omega(s)\)</span>. By the implicit function rule, we have <span class="math display">\[
\frac{d x}{d s}=\frac{C_{x s}(x, \mathrm{~s})}{V^{\prime \prime}(x)-C_{x x}(x, \mathrm{~s})}&gt;0 .
\]</span></p>
<p>The inequality follows from <span class="math inline">\(C_{x s}&lt;0\)</span> and the concavity of the objective function. The derivative in (13) corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(\Omega^{\prime}(s)\)</span> and indicates that larger scale increases the Congress’s optimizing choice of output up to <span class="math inline">\(\bar{s}\)</span>, at which point the net social surplus disappears. In fact, the unique (second-best) equilibrium program occurs at <span class="math inline">\((\bar{x}, \bar{s})\)</span>. The military exploits its first-mover advantage by choosing <span class="math inline">\(\bar{s}\)</span> and, in doing so, extracts all of the social surplus which is driven to zero at <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is easy to show that the equilibrium leads to greater than first-best scale and output - i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}&gt;x^*\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{s}&gt;s^*\)</span>. When, for example, the firstbest condition <span class="math display">\[
V^{\prime}(x)-C_x(x, s)=0,
\]</span> is evaluated at <span class="math inline">\((\bar{x}, \bar{s})\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[

<p>The Rogerson game analysis allows us to understand better that the manner in which procurement decisions are organized may lead to strategic interactions that do not further society’s interest. This is an important insight, since it can be used to design more optimal procurement structures. For example, Rogerson (1990, 1991a) investigated the beneficial effects of fixing a budget prior to the sequential game. With sufficient foresight, this budget setting process could result in a first-best outcome. When player’s interests are not concerned with the same objective functions, strategic interactions become a crucial consideration. The introduction of additional constraints, such as an incentive compatible mechanism, can lead to a better outcome. Game theory is a particularly appropriate tool for analyzing procurement.</p>

<p>At the policy level, governments have used various strategies to ensure that private firms fulfil! defense contracts at reasonable cost, in a timely manner and with suitable quality. These strategies have included (Burnett and Kovacic, 1989; Laffont and Tirole, 1993; Rob, 1986): (i) Incentive contracts; (ii) Various regulatory arrangements relating to the disclosure of costs and control of profits. (iii) The use of competition at various stages in a project’s life cycle.</p>
<p>The new economics of defense contracting starts from the distinctive features of the defense market: a) In the domestic market, the buying side is dominated by a single large customer. The customer can be lobbied but it can be, and has been, a producer in the industry; it also has taxation, regulatory, and coercive powers. Furthermore, the buyer operates in a political market place where procurement choices can be influenced by lobbying and by vote considerations (Lichtenberg, 1989). b) The use of costly, rapidly changing, high technology means that procurement is dominated by uncertainty about buyer requirements, cost, and performance requirements. c) The market is characterized by information gaps and asymmetries. Differences in the information available to the buyer and sellers accentuates uncertainty. Contractors have a comparative advantage over the knowledge of the technological possibilities and cost conditions, but buyers have some advantage through their monop­sony powers and ability to change their requirements frequently. Not surprisingly, pre-and post-contractor opportunism and strategic behavior occur on both sides of the buyer-seller relationship (e.g., the buyer can threaten to cancel a project or buy from abroad; or the buyer can use any cost information gained from post-costing to drive a “hard bargain” on future contracts; or it can threaten renegotia­tion of profits). d) Contractual relationships are often long-term extending over many years and embracing design, development, production, and in-service support. Long-term contracts agreed under uncertainty cannot be specified completely. Such contracts are inevitably incomplete because: (i) It is impossible to anticipate all future contingencies. In bidding, firms will specify multiple parameters reflecting various con­tingencies (i.e., the terms on which it will accept the contract). (ii) The appropriate response to uncertainty is not apparent at the start of the contract. (iii) It is costly to write complex contingent contracts where there is bounded rationality, so preventing identification of all contingencies and the specification of desired actions for each contingency. (iv) Some long-term transactions require the supplier to invest in specific human and physical capital which is contract specific. At the same time, the buyer cannot turn to alternative suppliers without incurring additional set-up costs. Ex post, once specific investments have occurred, the parties will be in bilateral monopoly; and the absence of ex post competition increases the possibility of opportunism (i.e., one party capturing gains). In principle, then, a long-term contract has to ex-post guarantee the parties a fair return ex ante to encourage the investments (Baron, 1988; Tirole, 1986 ad 1988; Williamsom 1986). With long-term contracts, the problem is to find the optimal trade­off between flexibility and the prevention of opportunism. The problem is accentuated because long-term relationships tend to promote collusion between buyer and contractor personnel (e.g.&nbsp;defense ministry officials become friendly with the firms they have dealt with repeatedly: Tirole, 1988, p.&nbsp;27). e) Long-term contracts involving development and production work provide contractors with incentives to bid low to obtain the development contract and aim to obtain monopoly rents on the resulting production work. However, over the development and production program as a whole, it is likely that the contractor will earn only a normal return: hence, efforts to introduce separate competitions at both the development and production stages might encourage exits or a change in the relative prices of development and production work (Kovacic, 1991). In this context, a model has been developed where it is assumed that the initial contract is awarded competitively and that the winner will become a monopo­list subject to profit regulation. On this basis, the model shows that both expected contractor profit and government expenditure can be reduced by raising the profit policy mark-up. The result arises because not only do firms “buy-into” the initial contract, but also differential subsidization induced by the profit policy (higher-cost producers receive larger absolute mark-ups) promotes more aggressive competition (Bower and Osband, 1991; Rogerson, 1989). f) For high technology projects, the supply side is characterized by monopoly or oligopoly. Also, most contractors are multi-product firms with a variety of military and civil products. The fact that, at any one time, a firm has a number of defense contracts creates product cost measurement problems and further possibilities for opportunistic behavior by the buyer and seller. g) The industry is regulated with regulations on cost estimating, accountancy practices, and the profitability of noncompetitive work. Regulations also determine how future contingencies and disagree­ments between the buyer and the regulated firm will be resolved. Defence ministries often fear that firms will be dishonest in negotiatig fixed-prices and will exploit opportunities for shirking in meeting quality specifications: hence, governments have adopted eloborate regulatory requirements including equality of information, truth in negotiotions laws, post costing, and renegotiation of excessive profits. Similarly, investments for firms to shirk on quality are policed hy including warranties in contracts and by maintaining inspection teams at the contractors’ plants (Baron, 1988; Laffont and Tirole, 1986).</p>
<p>These distinctive features of defense markets have determined contrac­tual relationships (i.e., the terms of exchange between buyer and seller). Contracting for standard items is relatively simple (e.g.&nbsp;batteries, cars, office furniture). The real problems arise with the need to negotiate long­term contracts under uncertainty where the contractual relationship is complicated by asymmetrical information, adverse selection, moral hazard, risk sharing, and monitoring (Baron and Besanko, 1987). Fixed­price, cost reimbursement and incentive contracts are the policy instru­ments available to “solve” these procurement problems.</p>
<section id="fixed-price-contracts" class="level3" data-number="2.7.1">
<h3 data-number="2.7.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fixed-price-contracts"><span class="header-section-number">2.7.1</span> Fixed Price Contracts</h3>
<p>Fixed-price contracts are usually adopted under competition or sole source purchasing where there are few technological and economic uncertainties. But governments might be reluctant to sign fixed-price contracts where there are information asymmetries. Governments might be ignorant about a firm’s cost conditions so that they are unable to dispute ex ante cost estimates. In the circumstances, firms can earn informational rents. Laffont and Tirole (1986) have considered some of the conditions for optimal incentive contracts when the contractor’s costs can be observed, concluding that the optimal contract moves toward a fixed-price contract as demand increases.</p>
<p>Underlying fixed-price and other incentive contracts is the assumption that firms are profit-maximizers. However, in imperfect (and regulated) markets, the pursuit of other objectives, such as the maximization of sales, growth or utility, or even satisficing, means that firm behavior will depart from that implied by the profit-maximizing model (Cummins, 1977; Demong and Strayer, 1981). For example, long-run sales max­imization may be served by hiring additional R &amp; D staff on defense contracts with the aim of increasing the firm’s advantage in future competitions or even to improve its position in civil markets (Cummins, 1977). In these circumstances, the pursuit of aims other than maximum profits needs to be recognized when formulating incentives and regula­tory arrangements for defense contracts (Hartley, 1991b, p.&nbsp;88). Simi­larly, on the buying side, it is often assumed that procurement and regulatory agencies are acting in the public interest, maximizing social welfare or minimizing program costs (Laffont, 1986). Instead, they might be maximizing budgets, or satisficing or seeking a quiet life, nil of which will affect contractor behavior. For example, procurement staff might “satisfice” in contract negotiations if they lack performance incentives in their employment contracts and if they can rely on regulation, post­costing, and renegotiation of “excessive” profits.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.7.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cost-plus-contracts"><span class="header-section-number">2.7.2</span> Cost Plus Contracts</h3>
<p>Cost-plus contracts avoid excessive profits but there is the potential for cost maximization. With cost-plus contracts, the government acts as an insurer providing full insurance to the firm by bearing all the risks (Kovacic, 1991). Here, it has been suggested that if the firm is risk averse and the government buyer is risk neutral (due to the size of the financial assets it commands and the ability to pool risks), cost-plus contracts represent an optimal risk-sharing arrangement - but they are inefficient (Samuelson, 1983). In contrast, fixed-price contracts will include a risk premium for meeting cost uncertainties (i.e., a risk premium which is charged to the government by the winning firm). But in terms of risk sharing, it has been suggested that fixed-price contracts are suboptimal, although they offer efficiency advantages (Samuelson, 1983). The implica­tions for contractor profitability of these limiting cases can be shown</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathrm{II}_{\mathrm{a}}=\mathrm{II}_{\mathrm{t}}+s\left(C_{\mathrm{t}}-C_{\mathrm{a}}\right),

<p>The extremes of fixed-price and cost-plus contracts show the trade-offs between risk sharing (insurance) and efficiency. The problem for procurement agencies is to formulate an incentive contract which specifies an optimal insurance arrangement between the contractor and the government, which contains desirable risk-sharing features and which provides incentives for efficient performance (Cummins, 1977; Peeters, 1993; Samuelson, 1983).</p>

<section id="incentive-contracts" class="level3" data-number="2.7.3">
<h3 data-number="2.7.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="incentive-contracts"><span class="header-section-number">2.7.3</span> Incentive Contracts</h3>
<p>Incentive contracts can be viewed as a compromise between the extremes of fixed-price and cost-plus (Cannes, 1975; McCall, 1970; Moore, 1967).</p>
<p>All too often, defense ministries make an all or nothing choice: cost-plus or fixed price. In fact, McAfee and McMillan argue that the optimal contract is never cost-plus, may be fixed-price, but is usually an incentive contract (McAfee and McMillan, 1986). Using various simulations, they show that, compared with fixed-price contracts, incentive contracts result in cost savings ranging from under 1 to 35 percent, with a median saving of some 3 percent (McAfee and McMillan, 1986, p.&nbsp;333). However, this result is based on a number of highly restrictive assumptions about the buyer having perfect information on a firm’s ex post costs, that accounting costs approximate opportunity costs, that principal and agent do not incur transaction costs in the bidding process, and that bidders differ only in their expected costs. Relaxing such assumptions could easily lead to increased costs which could more than absorb the typical estimated 3 percent saving from incentive contracts (McAfee and McMil1an, 1986, p.&nbsp;335, footnote 16; Laffont, 1986).</p>
<p>With incentive contracts, there will be bargaining between buyer and seller about the target cost, the target profit, the sharing ratio, and the government’s maximum price liability. For US defense contracts between 1978 and 1984, sharing rates varied between 15 percent and 25 percent, although there were examples of 50 percent sharing. 2 Of course, with incentive contracts, firms will aim to negotiate a high cost target, a favorable (to the firm) sharing arrangement, and a high maximum price liability (De Mayo, 1983). To control such behavior, proposals have been made for budget-based schemes. Under these proposals, the incentive fee depends on actual costs and on a cost estimate which the firm selects at the start of the project (i.e., the firm selects a budget in the form of a target cost) and the incentive fee is proportional to the budget variance. Analysis suggests that budget-based schemes create desirable reporting and performance incentives. As a result, the government receives information that is useful for its budget-planning process since the contracting firm has an incentive to submit true, realistic, and unbiased cost estimates (Reichelstein, 1992).</p>
<p>In a model of incentive contracting developed by Cummins (1977), it is argued that the popular public policy focus on the percentage profit fee and the magnitude of cost overruns on the contract is misplaced simply because these factors provide no useful information on the efficiency of the incentive contracting mecha􀁏sm, nor the extent to which actual project costs are being controlled. Instead, attention should be directed at learning more about the contractor’s attitudes toward risk and moral hazard (Cummins, 1977). However, procurement agencies might find it both difficult and costly to learn about such subjective factors amongst a firm’s managers.</p>
<p><img src="fig_5_2.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The relationship between fixed-price, cost-plus, and incentive contracts is shown in figure 5.2. In the figure, price is based on estimated costs <span class="math inline">\(C_0\)</span> plus a target profit, <span class="math inline">\(\Pi_t\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(P_0 = C_0 + \Pi_t\)</span> (Poussard, 1983)]. Fixed­price contracts are represented by a horizontal price line, cost-plus by a positive slope with profits as a mark-up on the 45° line, and incentive contracts are intermediate between the two, the slope of the line reflecting the sharing ratio.</p>
<p>Further insights into the efficiency properties of different contract types is shown in figure 5.3. This brings together the role of pressure (e.g.&nbsp;competition or regulation), the sharing ratio for the firm, a firm’s effort and its implications for efficiency (or the lack of it). In this model, high pressure (<span class="math inline">\(P_1\)</span>), together with a high sharing ratio (<span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span> = fixed-price contract), has favorable effects on a firm’s effort (<span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span>) -and high effort levels promote efficiency resulting in output <span class="math inline">\(Q_1\)</span> being produced on the lowest attainable average cost curve (<span class="math inline">\(AC_0\)</span>).</p>
<p>Shubik offers a fitting conclusion: “It is easy to produce a general impossibility theorem to show that no simple rule will be universally optimal for the multi-faceted needs of large-scale procurement” (Shubik, 1983, p.&nbsp;24). Auctions, for example, are efficient for selling many commodities but not for the procurement of large systems. Fixed-price contracts (sealed bids) seem attractive but there are risk-sharing problems, whilst cost-plus offers simplicity, risk sharing but poor incentives (Shubik, 1983).</p>

<h2 data-number="2.8" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="regulation"><span class="header-section-number">2.8</span> Regulation</h2>
<p>Defense contracting is dominated by the desire of government procure­ment agencies to negotiate contracts based on “fair and reasonable” prices (Kahn, 1993). Procurement agencies have the task of designing contracts which provide efficiency incentives without offering contractors excessive profits at the taxpayers’ expense. Competition is one possible policing mechanism. Where competition is possible, contract prices can be determined by market forces with competitive pressures stimulating efficiency and profits “policed” through entry and exit. But in noncompetitive situations, prices and profits have to be negotiated. For noncompetitive fixed-price contracts, “fair and reasonable” prices are based on estimated costs plus a government-determined profit margin (Sissons, 1986). Such contracts assume that contractors are profit maximizers and that procurement agencies can estimate efficient costs. However, if the procurement agency’s cost estimates are unreliable, it might agree “too high” a fixed-price which allows the contractor to earn “excessive” profits (i.e., exceeding the profit rate allowed by the government’s profit formula: see section 5.4). Such “excessive profits” result from estimating errors and reflect information asymmetries between the buyer and contractor. Predictably, governments have responded to the situation by introducing various regulatory arrange­ments concerned with equality of information, post-costing, and renego­tiation of profits, usually administered through a regulatory agency (e.g.&nbsp;UK Review Board for Non-Competitive Government Contracts: Hartley, 1991 b; Sissons, 1986). A procurement agency’s cost-estimating staff and its accountants, together with a clearly specified set of rules about allowable costs and overhead rates, are a central part of the process of negotiating and checking on “fair and reasonable” prices (Sissons, 1986). Accountants are also central to policing cost-plus contracts whereby contractors recover all actual allowable costs incurred on the work (Turnip, 1989).</p>
<p>Regulatory rules about allowable costs, prices, and profitability can affect firm behavior. Contractors in imperfect and regulated markets subject to, say, profit controls, have every incentive to pursue nonprofit objectives such as managerial preferences for staff, luxury offices, and a quiet life (Williamson, 1965).</p>
<p>Similarly, with cost-based pricing, defense firms have an incentive to shift more of their costs (e.g.&nbsp;from commercial business) to well-funded sole source procurements instead of to more competitive procurements. This can be achieved if the firm increases the amount of overhead allocated to a contract by increasing the amount of direct labor used on the contract. As a result, a contractor is likely to deliberately select too much in-house production (to maximize direct labor costs) for its products where income is cost sensitive (i.e., income depends on costs) and too much subcontracting for its products where revenue is not cost sensitive (Rogerson, 1992b). Elsewhere, it has been suggested that US defense contractors with cost-reimbursement contracts have an incentive to inflate pension costs (Thomas and Tung, 1992). These results are a development of the general point that, depending on how costs are allocated, a firm operating in regulated and unregulated markets may have an incentive to distort its output and/or input decisions so as to shift overheads to the regulated sector (Brennan, 1990).</p>
<p>Regulation is not costless. It involves policing, monitoring, reporting, checking and controlling functions which can result in substantial, but often ignored, transaction costs. Of course, regulation appears attractive to politicians who can use it to demonstrate that they are safeguarding the “public interest.” One study has examined the hypothesis that the US weapons acquisition process is overregulated with adverse effects on the timeliness and costs of developing weapons. The study estimated that regulatory control costs probably accounted for 5-10 percent of total program costs. There was, though, no evidence that regulatory activity had affected the performance or quality of the final product (either favourably or adversely). However, there was some limited evidence of delays, with acquisition times increasing at the rate of 15 percent per decade, although this could be due to other factors (Smith et al., 1988).</p>
<p>Continued criticism of weapons acquisition programs creates greater pressure for elected politicians and audit and procurement agencies to expand regulatory arrangements, thereby demonstrating that they are actively involved in protecting the “public interest.” However, it is possible that attempts by governments to micromanage procurement (i.e., monitor and control in detail) can have unexpected and undesirable consequences for the efficiency of procurement. Paradoxically, government efforts to ensure accountability and to protect the taxpayer can result in inefficiency and project failures - and hence demands for even more regulations and control to “solve the problem”! Extreme micro- management can destroy creativity and initiative and can lead to a focus on monitoring inputs rather than outputs (e.g., number of hours in the office). Indeed, an obsession with zero fraud and zero waste in procurement is likely to ignore the fact that the marginal costs of reaching zero targets can be prohibitive (Austin and Larkey, 1992). Furthermore, it is possible that the rising costs of regulation will have adverse effects on the willingness of firms to do business with the government. Typically, in the USA, all aspects of government contracting are governed by laws and regulation, usually introduced in response to some scandal, fraud, or abuse [e.g., false statements and claims, labor charges, bribes, collusive bidding (Failing, 1989; Weisman, 1987)]. The result of regulatory costs could be reduced entry and increased exit, making it even more difficult to maintain rivalry for defense contracts (Kovacic, 1992). In the circumstances, critics of US weapons acquisition programs have suggested that reforms need to focus on market-type incentives rather than increased government regulation (i.e., incentives and regulations do not go together: Gansler, 1989a and b; Baron, 1988).</p>
<p>More fundamental questions have been raised about efforts to reduce waste in the military and the usefulness of inefficient procurement. A public choice analysis shows the politics and pitfalls of reducing waste in the military. If waste in the form of excessive prices, expensive, gold- plated equipment, and operationally questionable weapons is so obvious, why hasn’t it been eliminated? Special interest groups in the form of the military-industrial complex are the major source of waste and the primary obstacle to reforms which would reduce waste. Lee (1991), however, questions whether it is desirable to reduce the political power of the military-industrial complex: the result might be an increase in the general level of inefficiency in the economy as the composition of government spending becomes more distorted toward other civilian special-interest programs. Similarly, a public choice and rent-seeking analysis of procurement has shown that inefficient procurement is useful and that there is optimal inefficiency in the procurement of public goods (Cowen and Lee, 1992). The approach uses two kinds of agents, namely, politicians and special interest groups. Politicians can award contracts to special interest groups. In turn, special interests in the form of defense contractors earn rents which can be used to induce politicians to procure weapons systems. In the absence of political rents, politicians have no motivation to incur the costs of setting a procurement agenda: hence inefficient procurement can be an optimal second-best means of encouraging public goods production (Cowen and Lee, 1992).</p>
<p>The role of profits in noncompetitive contracts is also a source of controversy (Baron, 1988; Greer and Liao, 1984; Pownall, 1986). On negotiated contracts, procurement agencies usually calculate contractor profitability on the basis of factors such as performance risk (e.g., technical risk; management), contract risk (e.g., type of contract), facilities capital (for land, buildings, equipment), and working capital, with the appropriate profit rates applied to either cost or capital (Hartley, 1992). Typically, the policy debate focuses on the regulation of profits. Such an approach fails to recognize that, from an economic perspective, profit consists of different conceptual components each performing a distinct economic function in the procurement process. On this basis, Rogerson has divided profit into two components. First, as reimbursement for some economic costs of production which are not recognized as costs in US government accounting regulations. Second, as economic profit in the form of an excess over the necessary economic costs of undertaking the contract. Rogerson argues that rather than focusing on regulation, profit policy should provide appropriate incentives for promoting innovation (Rogerson, 1992).</p>
<p>Given the regulatory constraints, questions arise as to whether the profitability of defense contractors differs from that of other firms. Lichtenberg has tested the hypothesis that US defense contractors are more profitable than other firms, mainly because of their ability to shift costs from commercial to defense business. Using econometric analysis for the period 1983-89, Lichtenberg found strong support for the hypothesis that US defense contractors are substantially more profitable than other segments (Lichtenberg, 1992). Similarly, a study for the period 1970-1989, found that the top US defense firms outperformed the market by a huge margin (Trevino and Higgs, 1992). For the UK, econometric analysis has been used to estimate the determinants of profitability for the UK aerospace industry (Hartley and Watt, 1981). There are, however, serious problems in undertaking empirical work on the profitability of defense contracts and contractors. A satisfactory model of profitability is required which allows for all other relevant influences (including uncertainty and risk, market contestability, and the role of regulation), and for the heterogeneity of the civil business of defense contractors. Data problems abound, particularly the absence of published data on the profitability of individual defense contracts (competitive and noncompetitive, etc.) and on the profitability of a defense contractor’s civil business. Opportunities also exist for applying economic models of regulatory capture. On this basis, procurement policy and regulatory arrangements might be consistent with the actions of an industry-captured regulator, who manages competition and regulates profitability among defense contractors for the benefit of the industry (Leitzel, 1992). For example, government cost estimators and accountants have discretion in accepting cost estimates and allowable costs (e.g., allowing a favorable price index and adjustment for inflation in fixed-price contracts); they can agree to offer profit rates at the top end of the permissible range; they can accept project modifications which benefit contractors; and they might accept jobs in the regulated industry.</p>

<h2 data-number="2.9" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="competition-contracts-and-performance"><span class="header-section-number">2.9</span> Competition, contracts, and performance</h2>
<p>Critics have often argued that defense contractors are inefficient and that inefficiency reflects the market environment of single source procurement: hence the suggestion that the introduction of competition should generate substantial price reductions (Burnett and Kovacic, 1989; Gansler, 1989a; Leitzel, 1992; McNaugher, 1990; Udis, 1992). Expressed more formally, it has been stated that “Competition solves the moral hazard problem by solving the adverse selection problem and that bidding decreases the rents received by the winning firm (Laffont, 1986, p.&nbsp;25).</p>
<p>Some proposals for reforming weapons acquisition, particularly in the USA, have been based on a preference for market-type incentives rather than increased government regulation. It is, though, admitted that there are no “right answers” nor any single change which would dramatically transform the US weapons acquisition process (Gansler, 1989b, p.&nbsp;9). Instead, a package of policy measures have been suggested such as improving the quality of acquisition personnel, streamlining the acquisition organization and procedures, expanding the use of commercial products, and a greater use of commercial style competition. With this approach, competition is seen as only one element in the model for improving the weapons acquisition process (i.e., other variables cannot be ignored). Interestingly, Gansler estimates that competition would produce net savings of 20 percent and such savings could be obtained from about 50 percent of US production programs (Gansler, 1989b, p.&nbsp;14; McNaugher, 1990). In the UK, competition was expected to produce savings of 10 percent on the equipment budget (HCP 189, 1991, p.&nbsp;3). Admittedly, such US and UK estimates of the impact of competition are “ball park” figures with no indication of the basis of the estimates; but such estimates do raise three questions. First, what is the evidence on the economic impacts of competition; second, how reliable is the evidence; and, third, why might the estimated savings differ between the USA and the UK?</p>
<p>This section reviews the economics literature on the impact of competitive procurement, including the effects on R &amp; D, scale economies, and performance indicators such as cost escalation, delays, and profitability. Some of these issues raise methodological problems: should performance on actual projects be compared with some perfect, ideal project never encountering problems or with the typical average project? This survey of evidence should also be placed into the context of current policy developments. The prospect of substantial cuts in future defense spending will mean a different defense market environment. The future is likely to be characterized by fewer new projects and smaller production orders. This is likely to create two conflicting pressures. First, pressure to move away from competition and instead, to provide support for “key” firms which are believed to be “essential components” of a nation’s defense industrial base. Second, the continuous search for “better value for money” will create pressures to “open-up” defense equipment markets to foreign competition (e.g.&nbsp;EU Single Market; also chapters 7 and 9). The result of a changing market environment is likely to be further modifications in weapons acquisition policies.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.9.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="defining-competition"><span class="header-section-number">2.9.1</span> 5.9 Defining competition</h3>
<p>Defense markets do not resemble the economist’s perfectly competitive model. Often, they are characterized by a single buyer, one or a few large suppliers, nonprofit-maximizing firms, uncertainty, imperfect information, and barriers to entry and exit (Gansler, 1989a; Hartley, 1991b). However, this interpretation ignores second-best considerations, the role of contestability and the contribution of Austrian economics. It also takes a limited view of a market since the number of actual and potential suppliers in a national market can be increased by “opening-up” the market to allow foreign firms from the rest of the world to bid for national defense contracts.</p>
<p>The standard economic case for competition in defense equipment markets is that it “spurs efficiency, alters attitudes and lowers prices” (Bittleston, 1990, p.&nbsp;62). What is interesting is the way in which attitudes toward competition have changed over time. In the early 1970s, for example, a US view was that competition was less desirable than single source procurement because (Fox, 1974, p.&nbsp;256): (i) Competition requires more time and effort (e.g.&nbsp;in evaluating proposals). (ii) Competition increases the chances of disputes and protests from contractors. (iii) Competition disrupts long-established relationships between the government and contractors. (iv) Competition requires government to evaluate the capabilities of rival firms.</p>
<p>But already in the early 1970s, US policy was changing. Under the Packard Initiatives of 1970, policy aimed to restore competition to weapons acquisition: the aim was to extend competition between prime contractors throughout the development stage, SO avoiding developer monopoly when awarding initial production contracts (Dews, et al., 1979; Udis, 1992). There followed the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (CICA), which required the US Department of Defense (DoD) to use “full and open competition” through competitive purchasing. Next came the Defense Authorization Act of 1986 which prevented the DoD from beginning full-scale development for major systems until Congress received an acquisition strategy. This strategy required that competitive alternative sources be available for major systems and subsystems from the start of full-scale development to the end of production: hence dual sourcing and second sourcing for production work. Finally, the DoD Appropriations Act of 1987 required the use of competitive prototypes in developing major weapons systems. As a result of these Acts, competition became the primary acquisition strategy throughout the procurement life cycle. Exceptions are allowed under limited circumstances, such as a DoD finding that competition will increase total program costs without commensurate, offsetting benefits (Burnett and Kovacic, 1989; Gansler, 1989a). Similar trends toward more competitive procurement were also occurring in the UK during the 1980s [although without legislative sanction (Hartley, 1991, 1992; HCP 189, 1991)].</p>

<p>Traditionally, weapons were acquired on a single source basis, after a competition based on design and development proposals. The winning firm would be awarded a contract for both full development and all production work. As a result, the winning firm established a monopoly position with potentially adverse implications for innovation, efficiency, prices, and profits. However, as table 5.2 shows, there is considerable potential for introducing and extending competition at various stages in the project’s life cycle. Competition can, of course, be limited to domestic suppliers or extended to firms from the rest of the world (hence the need to define the geographical extent of the market). Typically, at the design stage, nonprice competition dominates as procurement agencies consider design proposals from a variety of bidders. Inevitably, at this stage, the risks and uncertainty associated with the project are at a maximum. The development stage could be characterized by competitive prototyping. This could be between two rival firms or two teams comprising groups of firms which agree to share risks and to share the work [the winning team members might later compete against each other for production contracts (Anton and Yao, 1990; Burnett and Kovacic, 1989; Gansler, 1989a; Leitzel, 1992)]. With competitive prototyping, there are trade-offs in the form of additional development costs but potential benefits through improved equipment performance, reduced risk of project failure, and reduced production costs (Gansler, 1989a; Burnett and Kovacic, 1989). At the production stage, competition can be introduced in various forms. The total production contract can be subject to competition with the winner receiving the total order (winner takes all competition); or an alternative supplier can be created SO that two firms will be able to bid for batches of production work; or a “storing” option might be possible whereby a second producer is created but not used [i.e., maintaining the threat of rivalry (Anton and Yao, 1987; Smith, 1983; Burnett and Kovacic, 1989; Leitzel, 1992)]. Once again, such policies involve benefits and costs. There are benefits through improved incentives to reduce costs and increase quality. Here, the assumption is that the intensity of competition affects unit prices through reduced profit margins and/or reduced costs (reductions in fixed or variable costs and shifts in the slope of the learning curve). Policy costs arise in the form of additional set-up costs, the costs of transferring technology, and a failure to exploit learning economies (Leitzel, 1992). In some cases, competition might not be worthwhile (e.g.&nbsp;small production contracts, high set-up costs, major learning economies). Such costs and benefits of competition now need to be analyzed in more detail, particularly issues concerned with R &amp; D, technology transfer, and scale and learning economies.</p>

<p>What are the likely impacts of competition policy on R &amp; D and innovation? A starting point in answering this question is to consider equipment procurement as a multi-stage process embracing design, development, initial production, and full production (see table 5.2). With sole source procurement, competing firms will bid “vigorously” (bid low) for the development contract and plan to earn monopoly profits on the resulting contracts for production and spares (ex ante competition; ex post monopoly). Whether the winning firm earns monopoly profits over the program as a whole will depend on the extent of competition at the time of the initial contract award. Competition at the initial award stage will tend to lead to a winning bid which results in normal profits in the long run. If, however, at the initial competition stage, bidders expect a second source, they are likely to bid less aggressively for the initial production contract: hence defense ministries pay higher prices for initial production but this might be exactly offset by savings on second source reprocurement. Thus, if the initial contract award for development and production is competitive, then competition at the production stage (e.g.&nbsp;dual and second sourcing) is unlikely to lead to significant improvements in weapons procurement (Riardon and Sappington, 1989; Leitzel, 1992). But, as Leitzel asks: is the initial contract award held in a competitive environment? (Leitzel, 1992, p.&nbsp;46).</p>
<p>Can competition have an adverse effect on innovation? Rogerson has argued that profits (prizes) on production contracts represent a reward for earlier innovative activity by defense contractors. In such circumstances, rent-seeking firms will spend their own money in an effort to win the production contract (e.g.&nbsp;innovation through privately funded R &amp; D; or lobbying, etc.). It follows that competitive procurement policies, such as dual or second sourcing, which reduce the economic profit on production contracts may reduce innovation (Rogerson, 1989).</p>

<h3 data-number="2.9.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="technology-transfer"><span class="header-section-number">2.9.3</span> Technology transfer</h3>
<p>Competition at the production stage requires technology transfer and this might be costly. The creation of an alternative producer requires the transfer of technology from the initial developer. This can involve costs through legal disputes about intellectual property rights, as well as costs in actually ensuring that a second source fully understands the initial developer’s drawings, designs, and specifications (e.g., the original supplier has incentives to hoard valuable information and to conceal knowledge from the second supplier). Experience with voluntary, commercially motivated technology transfer, as reflected in international coproduction programs, suggests that it is feasible to transfer production technology at a reasonably modest cost (Hall and Johnson, 1967, p.&nbsp;vii).</p>
<p>Technology transfer also involves indirect costs. US experience with the CICA of 1984 is illuminating. Originally, the DoD interpreted the CICA 1984 competition laws as requiring all bidders to offer to relinquish proprietary technical data rights as part of their proposals. Private developers submitting proposals which restricted the government’s data rights were often eliminated from the competition (prime contractors bidding for DoD contracts often imposed similar requirements on innovative subcontractors). Not surprisingly, such requirements affected entry and exit. Firms with commercial markets which might be adversely affected by government data rights requirements, are likely to exit from the initial bidding if the value of their commercial operations is high relative to the expected profitability of defense contracts. Predictably, the CICA was modified in 1988: contractors relying on privately developed products which they offer to DoD are not to be disadvantaged in the competitive process. This modification aimed to provide private industry with an incentive to invest in risky new technology (Brunette, 1989).</p>

<p>Competition at the production stage appears attractive. It can take the form of dual sourcing which involves simultaneous production from two suppliers: production is split between the two firms, with the majority of production awarded to the lower-cost producer in the previous award. Alternatively, with second sourcing, a second supplier is created (via technology transfer) and all future production contracts are awarded to one of the two firms in a “one-off” competition (Burnett, 1987; Leitzel, 1992). At first sight, though, competitive procurement for production work involves costs. If the original developer has undertaken initial production work, it will have acquired production (learning) experience which should be reflected in a unit cost advantage over a new entrant; and the advantage to the incumbent will be increased by the size of the set-up costs needed to create a second supplier (Anton and Yao, 1987; Gansler, 1989a; Leitzel, 1992). However, it is argued that introducing competition at the production stage will limit sole source monopoly profits and provide incentives to remove X-inefficiency in the incumbent firm. In this case, the new entrant’s costs provide information on the incumbent’s costs and a means of limiting the incumbent’s rents. Indeed, it has been suggested that it may be optimal to replace the incumbent, even when the entrant has higher production costs (Demski, et al., 1987).</p>
<p><img src="figure_5_4.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The learning curve provides an analytical framework for evaluating the relative merits of single source versus competitive procurement in production, as shown in figure 5.4 (Gansler, 1989a). Assume that prices are based on unit costs and that the aim is to buy quantity <span class="math inline">\(0q_2\)</span> in two equal batches of <span class="math inline">\(0q_1\)</span>. The original developer is asked to produce the initial output <span class="math inline">\(0q_1\)</span>, after which the production work is subject to competition. The original developer will produce <span class="math inline">\(Oq_1\)</span> at a unit cost of <span class="math inline">\(C_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0_q2\)</span> (the sole source solution) at a unit cost of <span class="math inline">\(C_1\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(LC_1\)</span> (figure 5.4). If <span class="math inline">\(LC_1\)</span> is X-efficient, then the incumbent will win any competition by offering to supply <span class="math inline">\(q_2 - q+1( 0q_1)\)</span> at a unit cost substantially below <span class="math inline">\(C_2\)</span> (reflecting marginal rather than average costs), compared with a new entrant’s unit costs of <span class="math inline">\(C_2\)</span> for the second production batch <span class="math inline">\((0q_1)\)</span>. But, if the original developer is not X-efficient, then a second supplier might have lower unit costs reflected in a lower and steeper learning curve, <span class="math inline">\(LC_0\)</span>. Thus, the new entrant offers <span class="math inline">\(0q_1\)</span> (second batch) at a unit cost of <span class="math inline">\(C_0\)</span> and the savings from competition are <span class="math inline">\(C_1 - C_0\)</span>, and not <span class="math inline">\(C)2\)</span> Co (i.e., the sole source producer would have been at C1 on LC1).</p>

</div>
<p>Figure 5.4 can be modified to allow the sole source producer to respond to the threat of entry. An example is shown in figure 5.5. Contestability might shift the sole source cost curve from ABC (LC1 without rivalry, as in figure 5.4) to ABDE with rivalry as in figure 5.5: this would maintain the incumbent’s unit cost advantage over the new entrant (the incumbent would offer a unit cost below <span class="math inline">\(C_1\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(q_2 - q_1\)</span>). Of course, the framework outlined in figures 5.4 and 5.5 is no more than a starting point and it raises a set of questions:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>What assumptions should be made about the sole source learning curve under competition? Will the sole source supplier offer lower unit costs than the new entrant due to the removal of X-inefficiency and the advantages of production experience?</li>
<li>What would happen to unit costs in the absence of competition (the counterfactual)?</li>
<li>Is it reasonable to assume that defense production is a decreasing cost activity: what about the possibility that for some activities, and some scales of production, unit costs might rise?</li>
<li>What are the pricing assumptions - will competition reduce profit margins as well as unit costs?</li>
<li>What is the likely impact of other influences (e.g., expectations about future cuts in defense spending)?</li>
<li>What are the costs of competition compared with monitoring, policing, and auditing a sole source producer?</li>
</ol>
<p>Evidence on the savings due to competition has focused on the production stage. Researchers have estimated savings by using learning curves and assuming that prices reflect contractor costs (see figures 5.4 and 5.5). A survey of the US empirical literature estimated average savings due to competition ranging from 11 percent to 53 percent, with a median saving of 33 percent. However, one study found that dual sourcing was more expensive than sole sourcing. Moreover, once allowance is made for start-up costs, it is not always obvious that savings were realized. Interestingly, the second source won most of the competi- tions (Anton and Yao, 1990). But, after reviewing the literature, Anton and Yao have concluded that the empirical studies on competitive savings are flawed: “There is no question that the difficulties of measuring, much less forecasting, are immense, yet the magnitude of the problem is no excuse for models based on weak theory” (Anton and Yao, 1990, p.&nbsp;77).</p>

<h3 data-number="2.9.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="performance-indicators"><span class="header-section-number">2.9.5</span> Performance indicators</h3>
<p>Evidence is available on various performance indicators concerned with fixed-price contracts, cost escalation, and profitability. American experience with total package procurement introduced in the 1960s is illuminating. Under total package procurement, firms committed themselves to a single fixed-price contract for the development and production phases of the acquisition cycle. The “classic” examples of this approach were the Lockheed C-5A transport aircraft and the Grumman F-14 fighter aircraft. Both firms seriously underestimated their costs and incurred massive overruns and severe losses. Lockheed, for example, massively miscalculated the costs of building a technologically complex new transport aircraft which considerably exceeded the state of the art. As a result of huge cost overruns, Lockheed was driven to the verge of bankruptcy, from which it was rescued by a DoD unilateral price increase and Congressional loan guarantees. This experience highlights the problems of fixed-price contracts where projects involve substantial technological uncertainties. Such contracts are likely to involve defense ministries and contractors in costly disputes over the proper interpretation of the contract and its requirements. And, in the last resort, fixed-price contracts are difficult to enforce if the result is likely to be the exit of a major firm (Kovacic, 1991; Udis, 1992; Fox, 1974).</p>
<p><img src="fig_5_6.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Contract and contractor performance can also be assessed in terms of cost control, delivery schedules and equipment performance. A US study has estimated the impact of the 1970s Packard Initiatives, including the increased use of hardware competition. A comparison of competitive with noncompetitive programs supported the claimed advantages of competition. Competitive programs had slightly better performance and schedule ratios and substantially less cost growth (e.g., an average cost growth ratio of 1.16 compared with 1.53 for projects with little or no competition: Dews et al., 1979, p.&nbsp;28). It must be emphasized, though, that these results were based on a relatively small sample and might reflect the influence of “other factors”. Similarly, a comparison of the 1970s and 1960s programs is a further means of assessing the impact of the 1970s Packard Initiatives in the USA. By almost every measure of systems performance, program schedule, and cost escalation, the comparison favored the 1970s experience [e.g., average cost growth of 1.44 in the 1960s compared with 1.34 in the 1970s (Dews et al., 1979, p.&nbsp;57)].</p>
<p>Profitability is a further indicator of contractor performance and questions arise about the impact of competition on profitability. Under what circumstances does competition lead to reductions in production costs, to profit reductions, or to both? Consider the price reduction curve shown in figure 5.6 (based on a learning curve). The introduction of competition is predicted to result in lower prices due to two factors: first, a shift effect and, second, a rotation effect reflecting a steeper price reduction curve.</p>
<p>In examining prices and profitability, Greer and Liao have suggested that when business slackens and excess capacity emerges, prices tend to fall and profit margins weaken (Greer and Liao, 1986). Their empirical results suggest that when industry capacity utilization is below the 80 percent normal level, introducing competition into major systems acquisition results in price savings. With capacity utilization below 80 percent, the industry is “hungry.” Incorporating a role for capacity utilization might explain why dual sourcing results in added net costs as often as it has produced the desired net savings. Dual-source procurement seems to lead to net savings when industry capacity utilization averaged less than 80 percent: hence it is argued that introducing dual sourcing when capacity use is above 80 percent is unwise (Greer and Liao, 1986, p.&nbsp;1268).</p>
<p>There are relatively few empirical studies of the impact of the UK’s competitive procurement policy. Claims have been made of improved efficiency by defense contractors reflected in price savings varying from 10 percent to 70 percent, better export performance and a wider supplier base (Hartley, 1991b; HCP 189, 1991). Elsewhere, there have been studies of the impact of competition on the structure of the UK defense market showing reduced concentration and increased competition (Smith, 1990; Willett, 1993). Concern has also been expressed about the impact of competition on exits from the industry, on the costs of bidding, delays in reaching decisions, and on the reluctance of firms to invest in private venture R &amp; D with implications for innovation (Bittleston, 1990).</p>

<p>Although it has legislative support, US competition policy has to be implemented by procurement officials who have discretion in determining how to apply competition; and when exceptions are allowed (Burnett and Kovacic, 1989). The possibility arises of anti-competitive behavior by the buyer (rather than the supplier). Indeed, public choice analysis suggests that various interest groups in the military-industrial-political complex who are likely to lose from the policy will oppose it. Contractors prefer “cosy” relationships with the defense ministry, and procurement agencies prefer the simplicity of avoiding competition and continuing to work with known firms.</p>
<p>It also needs to be recognized that policy makers’ simplified economic models of competition are limited and can produce unexpected and undesirable results. Some examples can be given:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Estimates suggest that second sourcing designed to promote competition might lead to higher overall program costs of 40 percent compared with the cost of sole sourcing (Burnett, 1989; Mayer, 1991).</li>
<li>Contract winners expect lower future profits, SO that they invest less in R &amp; D compared with sole sourcing. Also, the prospect of reduced future profitability causes every bidder to bid less aggres- sively in the initial procurement phase compared with sole source acquisition (Brunette, 1989).</li>
<li>Teaming arrangements can lead to anti-competitive behavior [e.g., collusion, exchange of price data, cartels (Burnett and Kovacic, 1989)].</li>
<li>There are potential conflicts between competition policy and regulatory policy. Regulation assumes the absence of rivalry and it can impede competition policy. With rivalry and contractors assuming a greater financial risk, they need greater financial rewards for successful performance.</li>
<li>It has been argued that US DoD procurement practice is consistent with the actions of an industry-captured regulator, who manages the competition among defense contractors for the benefit of the entire industry. The stylized facts of source selection, contract management, and gold plated weapons can be explained by a regulatory capture model of the DoD (Leitzel, 1992).</li>
</ol>
<p>The examples given above show that economic models of competition will be implemented by agents in the political market place. Recent developments in game theory, strategic behavior, transaction costs, contestability, and Austrian economics have led to substantial modifica- tions in some of the more simplified interpretations of economic models of competition.</p>
